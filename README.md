# Digital Marketing Customer Classification App

This repository contains an exercise where I combine machine learning techniques and present the results in a web application for public use.

## Objective

The objective of the web application is to classify potential customers obtained from a marketing campaign database. This will allow us to identify, based on certain characteristics. The app used a modeling technique called uplift, which is an important yet novel area of research in machine learning that aims to explain and estimate the causal impact of a treatment at the individual level.

## Features

- **Machine Learning Integration**: Utilizes machine learning algorithms to classify and predict potential customers.
- **Uplift Modeling**: Implements uplift modeling to estimate the causal impact of marketing strategies.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Web-based interface to interact with the results and analyses.
